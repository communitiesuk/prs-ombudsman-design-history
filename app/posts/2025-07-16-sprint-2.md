## We designed and tested

1. AI chatbot using GOV.UK branding  
2. GOV.UK-style information directory  

### Prototypes
- [Sprint 02](https://prs-landlord-ombudsman-131a07ff82e5.herokuapp.com/prototypes/sprint-02/)
- p: p8ssw0rd

### AI chatbot using GOV.UK branding
Moved from a simple chatbot to a structured journey that collects the right context before asking an AI to draft advice. People picked the type of problem, said who they had spoken to, added any dates or details, then saw an AI generated answer formatted in GOV.UK style.

#### Approach
  - Added structure before using AI so answers are focused and relevant.
  - Give the model clear rules about tone, layout and allowed sources.
  - Keep things simple and reliable while we tested the value of AI content.

### GOV.UK style information directory
Tests a browse‑and‑discover model: users land on a structured directory with “Sections” and an A–Z listing that links to topic pages for tenants and landlords. This explores whether people prefer quick, direct entry to content over answering questions first.

#### Purpose
  - Validate a directory navigation pattern (sections and A–Z)
  - Provide quick access to common topics without triage
  - Offer separate entry points for tenants and landlords

## Research summary

Both prototypes worked, most users preferred the chatbot because they could explain their situation in their own words and get more tailored help. 

The directory felt familiar and useful for browsing, but users often didn’t know where to start. 

Neither tool made it clear what to do first in urgent cases, and both relied too heavily on external links like Shelter. Users trusted Shelter’s tone more than GOV.UK, which raised questions about GOV.UK’s role as a primary source of advice.


## Overall findings

- Both prototypes worked well  
- Most users preferred the AI chatbot because they could explain their situation in their own words and get more tailored help  
- The directory felt familiar and was good for browsing, but users often didn’t know where to start  
- Neither tool made it clear what to do first in urgent cases  
- Both relied too much on linking out to Shelter, and some users trusted Shelter’s tone more than GOV.UK

## Where both prototypes fall short

**Lack of clear, actionable steps**  
- Neither tool made it obvious what to do first, such as contacting a landlord or local council  
- Steps for escalating an issue were not clear or adapted to the urgency of the problem

**Reliance on external advice**  
- Both tools pointed users to Shelter for important guidance  
- Many users trusted Shelter’s advice more than GOV.UK, which weakened GOV.UK’s role as a trusted source

## GOV.UK directory pros and cons

**Pros**

- Familiar layout helped users feel confident using the site  
- Covered a wide range of tenant issues  
- Worked well for non-urgent needs where users had time to browse  
- Let users jump between pages without forcing a fixed flow

**Cons**

- Navigation was confusing and some topics were hard to find  
- Long pages made it easy to miss key advice  
- Did not give clear first steps, especially in urgent cases  
- Tone felt too formal or legalistic and less supportive  
- Relied heavily on external links instead of offering direct help

## AI chatbot tool pros and cons

**Pros**

- Guided flow helped users stay focused  
- Users could enter details which made the help feel more relevant  
- Felt modern and responsive  
- Prompts encouraged users to think through their situation  

**Cons**

- Some users got frustrated by repeated or off-topic questions  
- Did not handle complex scenarios like harassment very well  
- Final results were still too text-heavy and hard to absorb  
- Question tone sometimes felt cold or like a survey  
- Some users were confused by loading delays and thought it was live support

| Prototype        | Pros                                                  | Cons                                                              |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| GOV.UK directory | Familiar layout, detailed information, good for browsing | Confusing navigation, long pages, unclear next steps              |
| AI chatbot       | Personalised, guided, engaging                        | Repetitive questions, weak in complex cases, overwhelming at end  |

## Next steps

- **Keep developing the AI chatbot**
  It shows strong potential and meets user needs when it feels guided, relevant, and personal.
