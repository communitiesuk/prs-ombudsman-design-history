## We designed and tested

1. Landlord registration 
2. GOV.UK-branded landlord messaging service concept  
3. Unbranded landlord messaging service concept

### Prototypes
- [Sprint 04](https://prs-landlord-ombudsman-131a07ff82e5.herokuapp.com/prototypes/sprint-04/)
- p: p8ssw0rd

### An AI chatbot
Refined the journey to prioritise safety, make advice more actionable, and support returning to an answer later. It added an urgent issue branch, clearer questions about contacting the landlord, a consistent action plan in the AI answer, a print option and a way to retrieve a previous answer. It also linked to a separate prototype to help people message their landlord.

#### Approach
  - Put risk management up front through urgent triage.
  - Make advice immediately usable with a standard action plan and clear links.
  - Support people to continue later with print and retrieval.
  - Connect guidance to real action by linking to landlord messaging.

### GOV.UK-branded messaging service concept
A new concept: helping tenants and landlords resolve issues earlier by messaging each other within the service, with relevant guidance displayed. Journey includes a simple sign‑in, an account summary, a structured register flow (property, landlord, tenant details, check answers) and a chat screen that simulates a realistic message thread with a typing indicator and file upload.

#### Purpose

- Test whether guided, in‑service messaging can de‑escalate issues
- Keep users safe and on‑track with embedded guidance during chats

### Unbranded messaging service concept

Concept without the GOV.UK branding. It exists to isolate the proposition (role‑based messaging plus guidance) from brand expectations and visual design. The user paths and behaviours match the branded version.

#### Purpose

- Evaluate the early‑resolution idea independently of GOV.UK styling
- Check comprehension and trust when presented in a neutral brand
- Compare engagement with the same flow and content

## Research summary

The chatbot felt useful and personal, but still missed the mark in tone and didn’t handle complex cases well. 

The messaging tool was popular. Users liked the idea of sending formal messages to landlords through GOV.UK, and saw it as a fair, evidence-based way to raise issues. 

The video content was well received, especially when short and relevant, with transcripts as a useful backup. All concepts showed promise, but each still needs work to meet different user needs.

## AI chatbot overall feedback

The chatbot prototype tested well, but users pointed out several areas where it fell short.

**Key issues**

- **Tone mismatch**  
  Same tone and flow were used for both low-stress and high-stress issues. For example, harassment and wasp nests were treated with the same language, which didn’t feel right to users.

- **Lack of context for questions**  
  Users didn’t understand why certain questions were being asked. Without context, they second-guessed or got defensive.

- **Edge cases missed**  
  Some users said their experience didn’t fit into the structure. The landing page didn’t show examples like harassment, and emergency triage questions felt too rigid.

---

## AI chatbot pros and cons

**Pros**

- Familiar GOV.UK layout felt official and trustworthy  
- Logical question order helped users stay focused  
- Listing specific issues helped people identify their problem  
- Free text box gave users space to explain their situation

**Cons**

- Yes or no questions felt too limited in complex or unsafe cases  
- Text box guidance wasn’t clear, and users didn’t know what to write  
- Some users felt interrogated by the tone of questions  

---

## Messaging service overall feedback

This concept tested well. Users liked the idea of a formal GOV.UK-branded way to message landlords.

**Key insights**

- GOV.UK branding helped users feel the tool was official and fair  
- Many believed landlords would be more likely to respond if messages came through GOV.UK  
- The public and formal nature of the tool made it feel serious and useful in disputes  
- Users saw it as a paper trail that could support a future ombudsman decision  
- Most wouldn’t trust an unbranded version unless it clearly linked back to GOV.UK

---

## Messaging service pros and cons

**Pros**

- Clear purpose, users understood the idea right away  
- Felt empowering, gave users a safe and formal space to raise issues  
- Helpful to see tenancy, landlord, and local authority info in one place

**Cons**

- Users didn’t understand why they were asked to sign in
- Didn’t clearly show what happens next or guide users forward  
- Guidance was easy to miss or ignore

---

## Video content

We showed users a sample page with short video content explaining key topics. We asked how they felt about using videos in this context.

**What we learned**

- **Users liked short, relevant videos**  
  Many said they would watch this kind of content, especially under stress. It felt more accessible than reading.

- **Curation matters more than format**  
  Users were drawn to videos that answered confusing or urgent questions.

- **Layout worked well**  
  Playlist design was intuitive and people understood they could pick and choose.

- **Transcript mattered**  
  Some users didn’t plan to watch but appreciated having a readable transcript as a fallback.

## Comparison table

| Prototype        | Pros                                                              | Cons                                                              |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| AI chatbot       | Guided and personal, users could explain issues in their own words | Lacked tone variation, missed edge cases, unclear question intent |
| Messaging tool   | Felt official, created pressure, useful for evidence              | Unclear sign-in flow, weak next steps, easy to miss guidance      |
| Video content  | Accessible format, short videos, clear layout and transcripts     | Engagement depends on video length and relevance                  |

## Key insights

- **The AI chatbot format works well when it adapts to the user’s needs**  
  Users want flexibility, clarity, and to be treated like individuals. Trust in AI is high enough for them to accept it if it’s done right.

- **The messaging concept has strong potential**  
  Users want a formal, consistent, and visible way to raise concerns. GOV.UK branding makes it feel official and fair, which matters for both parties.

---

## Next steps

- **Keep improving the AI chatbot prototype**  
  Focus on better tone matching, edge case coverage, and clearer context for questions. It’s a strong option for self-serve triage.

- **Test the messaging service with landlords**  
  Explore what they need and continue to iterate on the design, content, and journey.
