## We designed and tested

1. Landlord registration for messaging platform
2. GOV.UK-branded landlord messaging platform   
3. Unbranded landlord messaging platform 
4. Platform generated emails

### Prototypes
- [Sprint 04](https://prs-landlord-ombudsman-131a07ff82e5.herokuapp.com/prototypes/sprint-04/)
- p: p8ssw0rd

## Email insights

**Trust and reassurance**

- Participants responded well to emails that looked official and were personalised  
- Seeing reference numbers and clear service names made people feel more confident  
- GOV.UK branding increased perceived trust

**Expectation management**

- Users wanted to know what is happening now, what will happen next, and when to expect it  
- Without this information, they were unsure whether to wait or follow up

**Registration email feedback**

- The registration email met expectations  
- Including the registration number helped build confidence  
- Tone, layout and content felt appropriate

**Tenant message notification email**

- The email titled "Your tenant has messaged you" was clear  
- All users successfully followed the prompt to sign in after reading it

## Landlord expectations and concerns

**Legitimacy and trust**

- GOV.UK branding made the prototype feel more official than private apps  
- Seeing formal confirmation helped landlords trust the process  
- Some landlords were cautious about how messages could be used as evidence  
- There were concerns about losing control over how and when issues escalate

**Expectations of the service**

- Seen as a backup if informal routes fail  
- Landlords wanted the service to be quick, fair and not overly complex

**Clarity and transparency**

- Landlords wanted better explanation of how the service works  
- Clear roles, timelines and outcomes were missing  
- Some suggested adding simple progress indicators to show where they were in the process

**Scepticism and concerns about overreach**

- Some landlords felt the platform was too government-led or formal for simple communication  
- It was unclear whether the service would be mandatory or optional  
- A few questioned the need for a government messaging tool when platforms like WhatsApp already exist
