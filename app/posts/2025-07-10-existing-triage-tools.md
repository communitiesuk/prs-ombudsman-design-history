As part of our exploration into existing tools that support tenants facing housing issues, we reviewed two existing services: the TDS tenant support tool and the MOJ housing disrepair tool. Our aim was to understand their original intent, design approach, current status, and any learnings we can apply to our own service development. 

While neither tool is currently in active development, both offer valuable insights into user needs, content delivery, and system gaps. Our next steps include testing elements of these tools with users, identifying opportunities for reuse or adaptation, and ensuring any future service is more discoverable, sustainable, and aligned with user expectations.

## My housing issue gateway

### Design approach

The tool was built to empower users without doing the work for them. It helped them understand their options, generate templated letters, and navigate a fragmented support landscape with minimal friction.

### Summary

The TDS tenant support tool was originally developed to help users navigate complex housing issues through a wayfinding approach. It began as a conversational UI/FAQ model but evolved into a more structured experience, guiding users to relevant information and actions based on their situation.

Despite an abundance of content on topics such as mould, redress schemes, and local authorities (LAs), the original research highlighted a key user need: contextual information at the right moment. The design aimed to follow GDS principles. Helping users achieve outcomes by surfacing relevant guidance in a timely and accessible way.

### Key insights from research

- Wayfinding model: Users often face multiple, overlapping issues but benefit from guidance that focuses on the root cause of a single issue at a time.
- Eligibility-led flow: Early questions helped determine eligibility and direct users to appropriate next steps, typically focused on keeping them in their tenancy.
- Proxy users: Many users accessed the tool on behalf of others (e.g. adult children helping parents), requiring the tool to support accessibility and indirect use.
- Privacy concerns: Strong reluctance to input personal data led to clear notices stating that no personal data is stored or retained by the service.
- Fear of repercussions: Consistent theme from TDS research was tenants’ fear of landlord retaliation, which influenced the tone and presentation of advice.
- Letter writing support: For many, this was their first time drafting a legal letter. The tool offered templated letters with user-supplied content, which proved effective. Approximately 60–70% of users completed letters for single issues, and 25–30% went on to address further issues using the same service.
- Overwhelm and preference for human help: Many users reported that writing letters was overwhelming, especially amid wider personal struggles. A majority expressed a preference for speaking to someone 1:1, though the service was intentionally designed to promote self-service.
- Terminology explainers: The team explored including definitions (e.g. What is an Ombudsman?) to support user understanding in a legally complex landscape.

### Summary

The Ministry of Justice (MOJ) Housing Disrepair Tool was developed approximately five years ago to raise awareness and support pre-court resolution for tenants experiencing housing issues. Originally created by a small team within MOJ to reduce court-related queries, the tool has since changed hands multiple times, and documentation is limited.

### Key points

- Current Usage: Very low, with analytics showing approximately 10 users per day. This may suggest latent demand but highlights significant discoverability issues.
- Decommissioning: MOJ has decided to retire the tool by the end of this year or early next year. It is not considered within MOJ's remit, nor is there budget available for its maintenance. There is potential to reuse or redevelopment this service for PRS. 
- Tool Status: Though underused and undocumented, MOJ acknowledges the tool’s potential usefulness and welcomes others incorporating or building upon it.
- Marketing & Visibility: It is unclear how (or if) the tool was marketed. There appears to have been little or no SEO or promotional activity in recent years. Further investigation is needed to confirm the platforms it was hosted on and any outreach efforts undertaken.
- Opportunity: The tool may still hold value for users and warrants usability testing to assess its viability as part of a broader housing support offer.

### Next steps

- Request any remaining documentation or usage data from MOJ.
- Investigate hosting platforms and historical marketing or SEO efforts.
- Explore testing the tool with users to evaluate whether elements can be integrated into future service design work.
