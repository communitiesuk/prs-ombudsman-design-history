## We designed and tested
1. GOV.UK-branded triage tool  
2. Triage tool with fictitious Arm’s Length Body (ALB) brand  
3. A GOV.UK-branded AI chatbot  

### Prototypes
- [Sprint 01](https://prs-landlord-ombudsman-131a07ff82e5.herokuapp.com/prototypes/sprint-01/)
- p: p8ssw0rd

### GOV.UK-branded triage tool

A simple, linear flow that checks a renter is in England or Wales, asks what users need help with (tenancy vs maintenance), then routes to relevant guidance and next steps. It validated the core language, tone and step‑by‑step approach using GOV.UK components.

#### Purpose

- Validate a minimal end‑to‑end journey for private renters
- Test clear language and basic triage before offering guidance
- Establish a GOV.UK‑style baseline for later iterations

### Unbranded (ALB‑style variant)

Explores a non‑GOV.UK look and feel. It adds a content‑rich landing page (cards, news, and key topics) and then links into the same underlying triage journey. It was used to test how content and calls‑to‑action work outside the formal GOV.UK brand.

#### Purpose
  - Explore an alternative branded experience and information‑led landing
  - Check whether users still find and start the help journey easily
  - Compare tone and layout to the GOV.UK baseline

### A GOV.UK-branded AI chatbot

This was a simple end to end journey to test the idea. People confirmed they rent privately in England or Wales, wrote a short description of their problem, then saw a basic advice page that reflected what they wrote. It proved the flow, tone and use of GOV.UK styles without any AI.

#### Approach
  - Build the smallest possible journey to learn from users quickly.
  - Keep content safe and consistent using GOV.UK components.
  - Avoid complexity so we could focus on language, framing and usefulness.

## Reserach summary

Users preferred the GOV.UK branding because it felt official and trustworthy. 

Both triage tools worked, but the unbranded one raised questions about legitimacy. Users expected to be guided clearly and wanted to know how the service would support them, especially in serious situations like disputes. Many also said they'd want the option to speak to a human if needed.

The chatbot was seen as modern and engaging but lacked clarity about what would happen after submitting information.

## GOV.UK vs unbranded prototype

- Most users preferred the GOV.UK-branded version  
- They said it felt more official, trustworthy, and familiar  
- When looking for help with tenancy issues, people wanted to feel they were dealing with an authority  
- GOV.UK branding gave that reassurance  
- Users did not mind whether the service was directly part of government or an ALB  
- What mattered most was that they received reliable support  
- Regardless of branding, users expected a single, joined-up experience without being sent to multiple organisations

---

## AI chatbot feedback

- User experiences with chatbots were mixed  
- Some were sceptical about AI but most were open to trying it  
- They had concerns about accuracy and trust  
- Many said they would use a GOV.UK chatbot if it gave clear answers and did not replace the option to speak to a human  
- One user had already used ChatGPT to help with a landlord dispute  
- Most expected to deal with a human during serious stages like disputes, usually over email
