## We designed and tested
1. A GOV.UK-branded triage tool  
2. A similar triage tool with a fictitious Armâ€™s Length Body (ALB) brand  
3. A GOV.UK-branded AI chatbot  

### Prototypes
- [Sprint 01](https://prs-landlord-ombudsman-131a07ff82e5.herokuapp.com/prototypes/sprint-01/)
- p: p8ssw0rd

## Summary

Users preferred the GOV.UK branding because it felt official and trustworthy. 

Both triage tools worked, but the unbranded one raised questions about legitimacy. Users expected to be guided clearly and wanted to know how the service would support them, especially in serious situations like disputes. Many also said they'd want the option to speak to a human if needed.

The chatbot was seen as modern and engaging but lacked clarity about what would happen after submitting information.

## GOV.UK vs unbranded prototype

- Most users preferred the GOV.UK-branded version  
- They said it felt more official, trustworthy, and familiar  
- When looking for help with tenancy issues, people wanted to feel they were dealing with an authority  
- GOV.UK branding gave that reassurance  
- Users did not mind whether the service was directly part of government or an ALB  
- What mattered most was that they received reliable support  
- Regardless of branding, users expected a single, joined-up experience without being sent to multiple organisations

---

## AI chatbot feedback

- User experiences with chatbots were mixed  
- Some were sceptical about AI but most were open to trying it  
- They had concerns about accuracy and trust  
- Many said they would use a GOV.UK chatbot if it gave clear answers and did not replace the option to speak to a human  
- One user had already used ChatGPT to help with a landlord dispute  
- Most expected to deal with a human during serious stages like disputes, usually over email

- Eviction content felt too broad and stressful  
- Some content was too vague or repetitive

## Next steps

- **Build on what worked in the GOV.UK prototype**
  Keep the clear, guided structure and tone that users trusted.

- **Improve clarity in all formats**
  Make next steps and escalation routes more obvious, especially in urgent cases.

- **Keep human support in the journey**
  Users want to know when and how they can speak to someone if needed.
